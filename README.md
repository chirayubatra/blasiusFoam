# blasiusFoam
A solver for incompressible laminar flow and heat transfer on a flat plate
- uses blasius equation
- ./Allwmake to compile the solver

## mySimpleFoam
- Modifield simpleFoam solver with temperature equation

### blasiusFoamCase
- a flat plate case to run and test the case with analytical solution
- ./Allrun to run the case, also calls ./Allplot to plot the results
